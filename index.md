## Dictionary definitions

I'm targeting journalists with this information, and they tend to use the [Associated Press Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com) as a reference. The AP Stylebook cites *Webster's New World College Dictionary* as the "first reference for spelling, style, usage and foreign geographic names," so it's my first reference here.

### The dictionary of reference for journalists

You need a digital subscription via the AP Stylebook if you want to see these definitions firsthand, but I've copied the relevant parts here:

{% capture quote %}
**writ large**

expressed, shown, or done on a larger scale or in a clearer or more emphatic way
{% endcapture %}

{% include authoring/attributed_quote.html
    quote = quote
    by =    "Webster's New World College Dictionary (excerpt of entry on [**writ**, second use](https://www.apstylebook.com/websters/webster-s-w-writ))"
%}

{% capture quote %}
**at large**

1. free; not confined; not in jail
2. fully; in complete detail
3. in general; taken altogether
4. ☆ representing an entire state or other district rather than only one of its subdivisions: often in hyphenated compounds [a congressman at large]
5. covering any area or many areas; not covering any specific area: often in hyphenated compounds [a critic at large]
{% endcapture %}

{% include authoring/attributed_quote.html
    quote = quote
    by =    "Webster's New World College Dictionary (excerpt of entry on [**large**](https://www.apstylebook.com/websters/webster-s-l-large))"
%}

Note that the definition of **writ large** comes from the entry on **writ**, which is an archaic preterite and past participle of **write**. The definition of **at large** comes from the entry on **large**.

Ok, but what about some examples? I happen to know a dictionary with examples.

## Why I made this

I sometimes hear people say "writ large" when I think they mean "at large." This is understandable; it has a fun flare to it. I personally take any opportunity I can to say "writ large."

You might be thinking, "Language is fluid! The meanings of words and phrases change over time."

You're right. It might even be silly to fight this particular change (if it is even happening; I don't have much data on this).

Nonetheless, I think it is useful to have phrases that mean different things and preserve the beauty of special phrases.

Maybe "writ large" will take on new meaning as [people use it more often](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=writ+large&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3), but I think it's worth also preserving its old meaning.
