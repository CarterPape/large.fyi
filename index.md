People confuse the phrases **writ large** and **at large**. Here is the difference:

> **At large** usually means **in general**.

## Dictionary definitions

I'm targeting journalists with this information, and they tend to use the [Associated Press Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com) as a reference. The AP Stylebook [cites](https://help.apstylebook.com/support/solutions/articles/66000344912-what-dictionary-does-ap-recommend-) Merriam-Webster as the "first reference for spelling, style, usage and foreign geographic names," so it's my first reference here.

### The dictionary of reference for journalists

Here are the Merriam-Webster definitions for the two terms in question:

{% capture quote %}
**writ large**

on a larger scale or in a more prominent manner
> the problems of modern totalitarianism are only our own problems **writ large**
{% endcapture %}

{% include authoring/attributed_quote.html
    quote = quote
    by =    "Merriam-Webster (entry on [**write**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/writ%20large#writ-large-anchor))"
%}

{% capture quote %}
**at large**

1. &nbsp;
    1. free of restraint or confinement
    > the escaped prisoner is still **at large**
    1. without a specific subject or assignment
    > critic **at large**
    {: type="a"}

2. as a whole
> society **at large**

3. as the political representative of or to a whole area rather than of one of its subdivisions ➝ used in combination with a preceding noun
> a congressman-**at-large**

4. at length
5. in a general way
{% endcapture %}

{% include authoring/attributed_quote.html
    quote = quote
    by =    "Merriam-Webster (entry on [**large**](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/large#at-large-anchor))"
%}

Note that the definition of **writ large** comes from the entry on **writ**, which is an archaic preterite and past participle of **write**. The definition of **at large** comes from the entry on **large**.

Ok, but what about some examples? I happen to know a dictionary with examples. Lots of examples.

### Another dictionary

The Oxford University Press publishes the [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com/), which they market as an "unsurpassed guide for researchers in any discipline to the meaning, history, and usage" of virtually every word in the English language. They absolutely deliver on this promise.

The definition in this dictionary of at large is extensive, with 14 different uses. I've included only a few of them below, but you can see all of them in the definition of [**large**](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/large_adj?tab=meaning_and_use#39734759). I've included selected example usages for each word, as well.

{% capture quote %}
**writ large**

1. displayed or expressed in a prominent way or to striking extent.
    > Near Eastern gods were often human beings **writ large**: they had bodies of human shape, quarrelled, behaved irresponsibly when drunk, and so forth.
    
    > She gave me a hug. Niceness **writ large**.
{% endcapture %}

{% include authoring/attributed_quote.html
    quote = quote
    by =    "Oxford English Dictionary (entry on [**write**](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/write_v?tab=meaning_and_use#13997200))"
%}

{% capture quote %}
**at large**

1. At liberty, free; without restraint or check.\
> I was **at large** again, hunted but free, in the vast sub-continent of South Africa.

2. With reference to speech or writing: at length; fully, expansively.

3. As a whole, as a body; altogether; in general.

## Why I made this

I sometimes hear people say "writ large" when I think they mean "at large." This is understandable; it has a fun flare to it. I personally take any opportunity I can to say "writ large."

You might be thinking, "Language is fluid! The meanings of words and phrases change over time."

You're right. It might even be silly to fight this particular change (if it is even happening; I don't have much data on this).

Nonetheless, I think it is useful to have phrases that mean different things and preserve the beauty of special phrases.

Maybe "writ large" will take on new meaning as [people use it more often](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=writ+large&year_start=1800&year_end=2019&corpus=en-2019&smoothing=3), but I think it's worth also preserving its current meaning.
